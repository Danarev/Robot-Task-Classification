# Robot-Task-Classification

## 📌 Overview
As part of a Statistical Learning Theory course, we were asked to create a project demonstrating different machine learning models studied during the course.  
This project focuses on classifying robotic manipulation tasks - including picking and placing objects - using sensor-derived features from robot episodes.

The dataset contains three types of robot tasks:
- **pick** – the robot picks an object from a bench
- **place_bench** – the robot places an object on a bench
- **place_cabinet** – the robot places an object inside a cabinet

The objective is to classify the task that the robot is performing using predictive machine learning models.

The data used to construct features is a 34-dimensional **Action** vector, which corresponds to velocity command signals transmitted to various parts of the robot.
